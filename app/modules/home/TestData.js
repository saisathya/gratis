    "description" : "While architects organize their sketches into designs with the final objective of realizing them in a physical state, other visionaries explore architectural caprices with no real expectation that they will ever be built to scale. In these cases, the constraints of geometries or perspective that would feature in site or floor plans, elevations, cross-sections, and axonometric projections – let alone the technical requirements of the materials themselves – hold less sway. The imagination can run more freely if the two-dimensional image is not intended to serve as a blueprint that crystallizes design concepts into a coherent and buildable structure. This exhibition brings together the work of five artists, each with significantly distinct aims yet whose creative expressions nonetheless are unified by their architectural references. Four have had little if any expectation that their fantastical designs would actually be constructed; the fifth is a photographer who has spent years documenting the built environments of self-taught artist-architects. They include Alexander Brodsky and Ilya Utkin (both born 1955, Moscow), who in the eighties and early nineties collaborated on the production of an elaborate series of fantastical drawings of structures that they knew would never be built, blurring the line between art and architecture; Olalekan Jeyifous (b. 1977), a Nigerian-born, Brooklyn-based artist, who has been inspired by the existing cityscapes of his homeland to reimagine them in ways that address real challenges of housing, transportation, and delivery of resources; Achilles G. Rizzoli (1896 – 1981), son of poor Italian immigrants, who was inspired by the grandiosity of San Francisco’s 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition to create a utopian new world, designed in grand Beaux-Arts style; and Fred Scruton (b. 1956), professor of photography at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania, whose images of American art environments – architectural structures created over a period of decades without preconceived plans or preliminary maquettes – reveal the profundity of his own artistic engagement with the work of these self-taught artist-builders. Artist Talk with Olalekan Jeyifous and Fred Scruton, 5-6pm, March 6, 2018. Opening Reception, 6-7:30pm, March 6, 2018. Gallery Viewing Hours: 10am-4pm, Monday to Friday, and Tuesday evenings 6-7:30pm On view through April 6, 2019 Natalie & James Thompson Art Gallery, Art Building #127 All events and exhibitions are open to the public free of charge.
